    ">Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a data science process of extracting information from textual data. Chatbots, sentiment analysis and Amazon Alexa are some of the applications of NLP. But to do any kind of data prediction we need to have data in structured format. Real workd data is messy and may present in any format. Though as a data scientist you will get data in CSV or JSON format most of the times, there are exceptions. Below is an example of PDF file from which we need to extract the title and subheadings for our use. "
